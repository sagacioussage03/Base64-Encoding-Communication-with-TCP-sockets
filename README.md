Base64 Encoder/Decoder and TCP Server
The server C program includes functionalities for encoding and decoding strings in Base64 format and serves as a TCP server that communicates with clients over the network. It encodes and decodes messages sent by clients and acknowledges the received messages. The server's main functionality involves handling client connections and processing their requests.

The client C program demonstrates Base64 encoding and decoding functionalities and acts as a TCP client to communicate with a server over a network. It allows users to encode, decode, and send messages to a server using a TCP connection.
